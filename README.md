# Computational Social Dynamics: An Algorithmic Study

### 🧪 Overview
This repository contains a collection of **Agent-Based Models** and **Simulations** exploring the emergent properties of complex social systems. Using Python and Graph Theory, I investigate how simple algorithmic rules can lead to profound macroscopic phenomena like polarization, inequality, and information entropy.

### 📂 Projects

#### 1. The Thermodynamics of Polarization
* **Model:** Deffuant (Bounded Confidence Model)
* **Hypothesis:** How limited tolerance ("energy") leads to inevitable social fragmentation.
* **Key Finding:** Identified the critical threshold (0.30) where society transitions from consensus to sectarianism.

#### 2. The Glass Ceiling Algorithm
* **Model:** NetworkX Graph Theory & Spatial Matching
* **Hypothesis:** How "efficient" hiring algorithms create topological barriers to social mobility.
* **Key Finding:** Strict matching criteria create disconnected graph components, mathematically proving the "Experience Trap".

#### 3. AI Model Autophagy (Model Collapse)
* **Model:** Recursive Gaussian Training
* **Hypothesis:** The entropic decay of information when AI models train on AI-generated data.
* **Key Finding:** Demonstrated variance collapse within 10 generations, highlighting the necessity of human interaction for system stability.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Core:** Python 3.10+
